Hello. We are living during a historic moment that&apos;s marked by difficult challenges, as we all know, on the East Coast, so that the world is shaken by the crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which highlights yet an even bigger challenge now kuraishi social and social environmental crisis. This requires us, all of us, to face a choice. The choice between what matters and what doesn&apos;t change the choice between continuing to ignore the suffering of the poorest Yamal and to abuse our common home, the planet, or in or engaging at every level that it has to transform the way we act. Science tells us every day with more precision that urgent action is needed and I&apos;m not dramatizing here, this is what science says if we are to keep the hope of avoiding radical and catastrophic climate change. And for this, we must act now that this is a scientific fact on our conscience tells us that we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of those in need and recognition, these sort of growing economic inequalities and social injustices. And that&apos;s the economy itself cannot be limited to production and distribution, and it must also consider its impacts on both the environment and on the dignity of people. But we could say that the economy should be strictly a creative. In itself and in its methods. In the way it acts, creative creativity, what I would like to invite you to go on a journey together, a journey of transformation and of action made not so much of words, but rather of concrete and pressing actions. I&apos;m calling it a journey because it requires a shift, a change that came from this crisis. None of us must come out to the same. We cannot come out to the same from a crisis we never come out of the same. It will take time. Effort and hard work to overcome it. We will have to take it one step at a time of the week, persuade those in doubt. Imagine new solutions and commit to carry them out. Our goal is clear to build an approach within the next decade, plus a world where we can meet the needs of the present generations and. Included, including everyone since her compromise without compromising the possibilities of future generations. I would like to invite all people of faith, Christian or not. And all people of goodwill. I intend to embark on this journey. From your own faith, or if you do not have a faith from your own intention, from your own good, will each one of us as individuals or members of a group, families, communities of faith, businesses , associations, institutions, can make a substantial contribution. Only five years ago, I wrote the encyclical letter Lerato C, dedicated to the care of our common home. She proposes the concept of integral ecology to respond, to respond together to the cry of the Earth, as well as to the cry of the poor ecology. Integrally integral ecology is an invitation to an integral vision on life aberrated, starting from the conviction that everything in the world is connected and that, as the pandemic made sure to remind us, we are interdependent on each other. And that, as well as on our Mother Earth. The television from such a vision stems to the need to find new ways of defining progress and measuring insincerely mythology without limiting ourselves to the economic, technological, financial and gross product aspects not done, but rather giving central relevance to its ethical, social and educational dimensions. But I would like to propose today three courses of action. Got to see, as I wrote in Lerato see the change and the right orientation for our journey of integral ecology required first that we all take an educational step. We. So my first suggestion is to promote at every level and education geared towards the care of our common home and developing the understanding that environmental problems are linked to human needs. You must understand this from the beginning, that you need to establish environmental problems are tied to human needs and education based on scientific data and on an ethical approach. This is important, both of them being encouraged by the fact that many young people already show a new ecological and social awareness and many of them fight generously for the defense of the environment and for justice. As a second proposal today, we must focus on water and nutrition. Access to safe and drinkable water is an essential and universal human right. And embracing it is essential because it determines the survival of people and therefore is a condition for the exercise of all the rights and responsibilities as an element, as providing adequate nutrition for all through nondestructive farming methods should become the main purpose of the entire cycle of food production and distribution. That has proposed the third suggestion is about energy transition. Who knows how a gradual replacement, but without delay of fossil fuels, with clean energy sources? We only have a few years essentiality, Galchen scientists estimate approximately, maybe less than 30. We have a few years, less than 30, 30 years to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Davis is not only must this transition be quick and capable of meeting present and future energy needs, he said it also must be attentive to the impact on the poor, on local populations, as well as on those who work in the energy production sectors. One way to encourage this change is to lead businesses towards the urgent need to commit themselves to the integral care of our common home is excluding from investments those companies that do not meet the parameters of integral ecology and equally, while rewarding those that work concretely during this transitional phase, change the law to put sustainability, social justice and the promotion of the common good at the center of their activities. Well, they already said many organizations, Catholic and of other faiths, have already taken on the responsibility to act in this direction. In fact, in fact, the earth must be worked and nursed, cultivated and protected. We cannot continue to squeeze it like an orange. And we can say that this request taking care of the Earth is a human right. These three proposals must be considered as part of a larger group of actions that we must carry out in an integrated way in order to find a lasting solution to these problems. The current economic system is unsustainable. From there, we are faced with the moral imperative and the practical urgency to rethink many things the way we produce, the way we consume our culture of waste, our short term vision, the exploitation of the poor and our indifference towards them. The growing inequalities and our dependence on harmful energy sources. And we need to think about all these challenges, ecology and integral ecology suggests a new conception of the relationship between us humans and nature. We support this leads to a new economy where the production of wealth is directed to the integral well-being of the human being and to the improvement, not the destruction of our coming home. It also implies a renewed politics conceived as one of the highest forms of charity. She yes. Love is interpersonal, but love is also political. It involves all peoples and it involves nature. Need to be there for all of you to embark on this journey. That they proposed in order to. And also my new encyclical fatality. As the term countdown&apos;s suggests, we must act with urgency. So each one of us can play a precious role. So if we all begin our journey today, not tomorrow, today, because the future is built today. And she goes to it and it is not built in isolation, but rather in community and in harmony. Thank you.
